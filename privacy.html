                <h1 style="text-align: left;" class="page__title">Privacy Policy</h1>
                <h3 id="by-using-the-redvid-app-you-agree-to-the-privacy-policy-given-here">This policy applies to ICG</h3>
                <p>ICG understands that your privacy is important to you and is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality and privacy of personal information entrusted to it.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how ICG handles and safeguards your personal information concerning the hosting of this website and the provision of diverse business advisory services in various fields such as corporate finance and restructuring, economic and financial consulting, forensic and litigation consulting, health solutions, strategic communications, and technology ("Services").</p>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="information-collection-and-use">Notice at Collection</h3>
                <p>ICG gathers personal information outlined below for specified purposes and durations. We do not trade or disclose your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising (“sharing”), nor do we gather or process sensitive personal information to infer characteristics about you. If you provide ICG with personal information about others, you are responsible for notifying them.</p>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="log-data">Scope of this policy</h3>
                <p>
                  This policy pertains to personal information collected and/or used by ICG as a controller as defined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and analogous laws (e.g., Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados, the DIFC Data Protection Law 2020, etc.). California residents should also refer to the section of this policy concerning their rights. Details about when we collect personal information are outlined under "When do we collect personal information" below.
                  
                </p>
                <p>
                  When providing Services to clients, we sometimes manage personal information as a processor (e.g., hosting client data on our e-discovery platforms). This implies that we process the information solely on our clients' instructions, who retain control of the information.

                </p>
                <p>Therefore, if our utilization of your personal information isn't addressed in this policy, you may need to contact the client (and controller) responsible for processing your information.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of these Privacy Practices, “Personal information” refers to information related to an identified or identifiable individual or reasonably capable of being associated with, or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific individual or household.</p>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="cookies">Cookie Policy</h3>
                <p>
                  ICG Consulting is committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information and being transparent about the technologies utilized. This Cookie Policy elucidates how and why cookies and similar technologies are employed by ICG to enhance your user experience on our websites.
                  </p>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="security">Information Security</h3>
                <p>
                  ICG has implemented reasonable technical safeguards, security policies, and procedures to protect personal information from unauthorized loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Measures include placing confidentiality obligations on staff members and service providers, limiting access to your personal information on a "need to know" basis, and providing relevant training to ICG personnel. We also maintain comprehensive policies concerning data incident response protocols. Our IT Security Program undergoes regular audits.
    
    
                </p>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;">Performing Services for Our Clients</h3>
                <p>
                  ICG retains your personal information for the duration required for the purposes it was collected, any compatible purposes established subsequently, or any new purposes to which you subsequently consent, or to comply with legal, regulatory, and ICG policy requirements. This period usually aligns with the period of your, or the relevant client's, relationship or contract with ICG, plus a period reflecting the length of time for which legal claims may arise following the termination of such relationship or contract. Some information (e.g., call recordings, tax records, and certain data demonstrating regulatory compliance) may need to be retained for longer periods. Personal information may be kept for shorter or longer durations if required by law or ICG policy, if subject to a legal hold (e.g., following communication from our regulator), or if identified through a data protection impact assessment that a different retention period is suitable.</p>
                
                <h3 style="text-align: left;">What is our legal basis for collecting personal information?</h3>
                <p>
                  Certain regulations, such as the GDPR, necessitate us to establish a 'lawful basis' for processing your personal data. Typically, this processing is justified by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fulfilling contractual obligations or taking steps to initiate a contract at your request (e.g., providing specific services as an individual client, or advising your employer/service provider to meet contractual obligations to you).</li>
                        <li>Complying with legal mandates, such as collecting client information for tax/accounting purposes or making disclosures to courts/regulators.</li>
                        <li>Performing tasks in the public interest, like conducting background checks for anti-money laundering and counterterrorism efforts.</li>
                        <li>Pursuing our legitimate interests while considering your rights and interests, especially in the context of service provision, client onboarding, and relationship management activities.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="links-to-other-sites">Retention of your personal information</h3>
                <p>
                  ICG retains your personal information for the period of time required for the purposes for which it was collected, any compatible purposes which we subsequently establish, or any new purposes to which you subsequently consent, or to comply with legal, regulatory and ICG policy requirements. This period of time will usually be the period of your, or the relevant client's, relationship or contract with ICG plus a period reflecting the length of time for which legal claims may be made following the termination of such relationship or contract. Some information (such as call recordings, tax records and certain information required to demonstrate regulatory compliance) may need to be kept for longer. Personal information will be kept for a shorter or longer period of time if so required by law or an ICG policy, if the information becomes subject to a legal hold (for example, following a communication from our regulator) or if we have identified through a data protection impact assessment that a different retention period is appropriate.
                </p>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="childrens-privacy">Children`s Privacy</h3>
                <p>ICG`s websites are not intentionally designed for or directed at children under the age of 16. It is ICG’s policy never to knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 16, except as part of an engagement to provide professional services.</p>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to this Policy</h3>
                <p>
                  By using ICG websites you consent to the collection, use and storage of personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on the websites. ICG reserves the right to make changes to this Website Privacy Policy from time to time. ICG will notify you by posting amendments to the Privacy Policy on this website.
